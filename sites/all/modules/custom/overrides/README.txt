Normally CKEditor and TinyMCE will insert a <p></p> when you press enter. If you press shift + enter a <br /> will be inserted.

This can be confusing for some people not familiar with how this works, I actually could not figure it out at first.

This module will turn the <p> into <br />. So essentially there are only line breaks when enter is pressed instead of paragraphs.
